## TC Plat Map

#### An interactive plat map for Traverse City, Michigan

A moderately exciting local property records and tax parcel map for Traverse City, Michigan.

Located in Michigan's "little finger", Traverse City is a lovely little town of about 15,000 year-round residents. It's really quite nice. You should visit. Lots of people do. Great food, wine, beer, lots of cherries, golf, beaches, and plenty of Midwestern hospitality.

I made an interactive and attractive visualization of Traverse City property values and zoning boundaries using public data gleaned from the city's website and official online tax parcel viewer.

Tools: d3.js, leaflet, Node.js, MongoDB, topojson, geojson, curiosity.
